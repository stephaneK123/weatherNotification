## ‚óÄÔ∏èGeneral Info  
### Why the project exists 
 This is a final project for a class. The task is to write and present a full Android Application. The deadline is 7 weeks. 
### What is the project 
 Our project is to write a weather alerting app that uses the openweather api to notify the user (through android notifications) about certain weather changes.
 These changes could by anything, with examples being: 
 - Hurricane or flood alerts
 - Humidity above 65% 
 - Tempature above 65F 
 - Incoming snowfall expected 
 - Sky will be clear (go outside loser)

### How is the project meant to be used 
 The project is meant to be used to gain experience with Android Studio and app developement with a team. The app is meant to be used for education purpose and
 as a reflect of past accomplishment. The app is meant as a learning experience, and therefor could have a few to a bunch of mistakes.
### Progress 
This is the list of tasks to have to be compled. The list will be update as need be and a ‚úîÔ∏è will be added once a task is completed.

## ‚óÄÔ∏èExpectations from Authors  
### How to work on the project       
 **Important** : 
 - The Master branch has the last FULLY (release ready) functional version of the app. 
 - The testing branch has the the most up to date fully functional (not revised or tested) version of the app. (All three author branches merged into one).
 - The author branch has the respective author's most up to date version of the app with thier designated features (Working UI, improved version..).
 
 It is important that everyone is on the same page. This github will be used for the production of the app and the final version will be on the Master branch. 
 All the authors have their own seperate **branch** that they will work on actively. Once an author is done with their work they will commit to thier respective branch. 
 Once enough progress has been made all the 3 branches will be merge to make a fully functional **test** branch. The test branch is meant to be used prior to the full
 merge into the Master branch. 

### Writing readable code 
 You are working as a team and not an individual. We can not read into your head and think how you think. It is important that you write clear and readable code.
 Here are things to keep in mind to make your code easier to understand
 ``` 
 You are responsible for the quality¬† of your code 

#1: You're responsible for code quality. 

#2: Use meaningful names. 
int x = 0;? 
int timeLeft = 0; //better 

#3: Write code that expresses intent.
public void boo();? 
public void changeFormat(); //better and less comments 

#4: Code should speak for itself. Less comments = less maintenance. 
the code should be readable enough and the more comments the more time spent fixing 

#5: Leave the code better than you found it. 
if you see bad code, fix it

#6: Single-responsibility code. i.e function does 1 thing well. Less arguments = better function. 
classes: most methods use most of the class' properties.
do one thing, do it well and do it only 

 #7: Tests (TDD). 
test driven development 

#8: Work on big picture skeleton, then fill in the details later (interface first, implementation later). 

#9: Independent components that can be used in different places.
things are not too attached to their environment
 #10: Master your craft. SPEND TIME AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHY
 
 ```
 
 ### Comunnication 
 You should be communicating with the team members to give update and ask for help. Everyone should be aware of who is doing what and when it is expected to be done. 
 Everyone has a task but that does not mean tasks can not be switched or delayed. If you are struggling ask for help or go to google. You should be commeting on your commits
 and giving a brief description of what you did. 

### Testing 
 Your own branch does not need to be fully testing until all the three branches have made enoough progress to make a test branch. However, it is in your best effort to
 test your code as you write it to save time. It is okay to test your code after you've made enough progress. Your code should be tested and have as less bugs as possible 
 proir to the team being ready to merge into the testing branch.
